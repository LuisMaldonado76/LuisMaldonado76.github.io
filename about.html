            My favorite subject would have to be Science or Math.
            I would like to take an advanced math course so that I can be a 1 year ahead of my grade.
            My hobbies are basketball, and listening to music.
            I personally like playing basketball because its a way to compete with my friends and we can see who really good.
            I'm currently on my school's basketball team and I'm enjoying it a lot.
            I am also a good student. I currently have a 3.4GPA.
